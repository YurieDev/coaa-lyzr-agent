# 💸 COAA – Cost Optimization Advisor Agent

A Lyzr-powered AI agent that helps developers, teams, and businesses minimize cloud costs when working with large language models (LLMs) and AI services.

## 🚀 What It Does

**COAA** acts as your personal AI budgeting consultant. It:
- Identifies where you're overspending on LLM APIs
- Suggests smarter, cheaper AI models for specific tasks
- Offers workflow tips like batching, caching, and rate-limiting
- Warns you about costly behavior:  
  > ⚠️ "You're running expensive tests too often—try batching!"

## 🧠 How It Works

Built entirely in [Lyzr Studio](https://studio.lyzr.ai), COAA:
- Uses Lyzr’s inference engine to receive messages and respond intelligently
- Is customized to act as a cost-focused financial advisor for AI workflows
- Responds to prompts like:
  > "What’s the cheapest summarization model I can use?"  
  > "How can I reduce OpenAI token usage?"
